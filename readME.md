# The Linear Algebra Practice Project

This was my way of practicing C++ (for CS 1337) and Linear Algebra (for MATH 2418)
simultaneously.

Undoubtedly, there *will* be pieces, or whole blocks, of code that could be done with uses of vector functions, 
but I'm creating this project as I learn C++. At the time of creation, we haven't even fully covered pointers yet...

## Goals
The goals for this project were pretty simple:
* I wanted an excuse to work with pointers
  * Namely, dynmaic memory
* Matrix operations
* Lastly, this is a great opportunity for me to practice my Git repo skills.

## How it works
The user will input how many rows and columns they want for 2 arrays. 
They can also specify if they would like for the array(s) to be symmetric.
The program will check to see if it's possible for the declared [Comment]: # (unsure if "decalred" is the correct word to use here)
matrices to be symmetric and tell the user if it's possible or not. 

Additionally, the program will let them decide if they would like to go back and change one of the rows/columns to a form that could be symmetric, or proceed with out the symmetry.

There is a choice of options on what you can practice.

1. A = CR
2. LU
   * This includes E matrices
3. LDU
4. Systems of equations


### Functions

My thought process when it came to functions was as if I was creating a library of my own.

### Test Files

At this point, there are no test files to display, but they will come even though I want the program to handle most of this in the terminal;
having to work with files will add a nice complexity to this project.
